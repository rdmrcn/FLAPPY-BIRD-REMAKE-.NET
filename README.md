Flappy Bird - C# Windows Forms
Flappy Bird is a classic style game where you control a bird and try to avoid obstacles. The game is developed as a C# Windows Forms application.

Features
Bird Control: Press the "Space" key to make the bird jump upwards. The bird falls due to gravity over time.
Pipe Obstacles: Pipes come from the right side of the screen at random heights at regular intervals. The bird must avoid colliding with these pipes.
Score: Each successful pipe pass increases the score.
Difficulty Increase: The pipe speed increases as time passes.
Game Over: The game ends if the bird collides with the ground or top boundary.
Menu: At the start, there are options for "Play", "Credits", and "Quit". "Play" starts the game, "Credits" shows developer information, and "Quit" exits the application.
